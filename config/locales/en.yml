  idea_page_text: "We believe in collective decentralized initiatives of medium to large scale projects where anyone should be able to participate and benefit. We aim to find projects with a ‘logical’ location on our planet. Important here is: a stable economy, trustworthy project developer, high energy yield for the solution and a reliable purchaser of energy."

  idea_page_paragraph_1_2_text: We encourage people from all over the world to invest and participate in renewable energy projects. Whether the project is in your neighborhood or on the other side of the planet, our cross-border focus is based on logical positioning of the projects.
  idea_page_paragraph_2_title: OUR INCENTIVES
  idea_page_paragraph_2_1_text: We are committed to connect you to quality projects which have a life span of 8 to 20 years. Global Green Energy Investments is structured in such a way that as long as the project succeeds we receive income as a percentage of the total money paid out to the investors. See the <a href="#video">video</a> for an illustration.
  idea_page_paragraph_2_2_text: The returns displayed on the investment page are the effective returns that you will receive. Only if you want to sell the stake before the prescribed lifetime of the project an administrative fee is incurred.
  idea_page_paragraph_3_title: RISKS
  idea_page_paragraph_3_1_text: To inform you on the risks we provide project memoranda. Furthermore in our dedicated <a href="/legal/#risks">risks</a> section we highlight the risks involved.

Investors have to make their own judgement to participate in a project. We emphasize that if you do not fully understand the risks regarding an investment, you should look for independent financial advisor to help you.

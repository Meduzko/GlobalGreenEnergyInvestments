  idea_example_project_title: Project sunny
  idea_example_project_example: Example
  idea_page_text: Global Green Energy Investments is a platform where socially minded investors meet green energy projects worldwide. These projects are carefully assessed and furthermore have certificates to ensure the quality of the project. When a project is sourced, assessed and approved a part of the equity or debt is acquired by Global Green Energy Investments. These stakes are connected to investors through a 3rd party fund.
  idea_page_paragraph_1_title: CAREFULLY SELECTED
  idea_page_paragraph_1_1_text: We are committed to connect you to quality projects. GGIG is structured such that as long as the project succeeds, GGIG receives income as a percentage of the total money paid out from the project to the third party fund.
  idea_page_paragraph_1_2_text: The returns displayed on the investment pages of the project is the fixed expected return that you will receive.
  idea_page_paragraph_2_title: Information
  idea_page_paragraph_2_text: Through the project memoranda we provide information to make an educated decision on your investment. E.g. insurances, expected KWh generated, power purchasing agreements, etc.
  idea_page_paragraph_3_title: A Walkthrough
  idea_page_paragraph_3_1_text: You choose a project you feel comfortable investing in.  You decide on how you want to invest and transfer your investment amount to the third party fund.
  idea_page_paragraph_3_2_text: Within this 3rd party fund the investment amount of all other participants is gathered until the required amount is reached. Using those funds the 3rd party then acquires a stake in the project.
  idea_page_paragraph_3_3_text: As the project starts to make a return on its energy sales (PPA), money is returned to the 3rd party fund. The 3rd party fund then distributes the money through interest payments to the participants. GGIG at this stage also receives a percentage of the yearly return to third party fund. Therefore it is within GGIG’s best interest to source good projects that are expected to fulfill their commitments.
  idea_page_paragraph_3_4_text: Generally projects have a longterm duration around 8-20 years. If unexpectedly the stake needs to be sold during the run-time of the project, we facilitate the possibility to put the stake on offer via our ‘trade’ section.
  idea_page_steps_title: Steps
  idea_page_step_1_title: Select<br>a project
  idea_page_step_1_text: Review project details so that you can make a calculated decision and feel confident with your investment. We provide information memorandums to inform you on the risks involved.
  idea_page_step_2_title: DECIDE ON HOW<br> MUCH TO INVEST
  idea_page_step_2_text: Determine the exposure to the project you are comfortable with and see what the expected returns are.
  idea_page_step_3_title: TRANSFER THE MONEY<br> TO INVEST
  idea_page_step_3_text: An independent 3rd party fund will oversee the transaction between you and the project.
